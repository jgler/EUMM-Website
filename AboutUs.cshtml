    <h2>What is Musical Medics?</h2>
    <p> We are a musical society made up of a choir, orchestra and various small ensembles. We don't have a minimum standard, never audition 
        and pride ourselves in keeping our rehearsals relaxed and fun so you can get a break from the busy student life. While we were founded 
        by medics, we are now all-inclusive and about half our members come from non-medical degrees. In order to hold onto our medical roots, 
        all the money we raise from our concerts is donated to medical charities. Take a look at the <a href="~/Charities">Charities</a> page 
        to see where our recent proceeds have gone and the suggestions for next term.
    </p><p>
        We generally perform a range of classical music and more contemporary pieces from film or theatre. Once you become a member, you can borrow digital and paper copies
        of our pieces online from our sister site the <a href="~/Library/">Music Library</a>, where you can also suggest/vote on pieces for the coming 
        term. 
    </p><p>
        Our small ensembles are a recent addition to Musical Medics and I very much hope they will continue this year. Last year we had 
        performances from our Brass Band (Gwyd and the Brasslets), String Ensemble, Flute Choir and Woodwind Quintet. 
        These groups don't have set rehearsal times so to get involved or start up your own just speak to us at rehearsals.
    </p><p>
        We also have an active social side so you can get to know the people who sit on the other side of the room! We do regular pub nights after 
        rehearsals and generally put on 2-3 socials per semester (see <a href="~/Events">Events </a> for our upcoming plans). In the past these have ranged from 
        cultured evenings at the theatre to lazerquest so there really is something for everyone. We also put on either an after-concert or 
        end-of-term ceilidh, which is an event not to be missed.
    </p>
    <h2>How often do you Perform?</h2>
    <p> The whole society comes together twice a year for our Christmas and spring concerts. The choir also takes part in the Medical school's 
        Anatomy Memorial Service where we give thanks to the families of those who have donated their bodies to science. There are also plenty 
        of other opportunities to perform that are more flexible. Last year we took the society on our very successful first tour to the Lake 
        District, we joined in with a group from Manchester Musical Medics and some of our smaller groups performed in Malones.
    </p>
    <h2>How can I get Involved?</h2>
    <p> At the start of the year you can find us at all the Freshers' fairs - see the events page for times and locations. Come along and have
        a chat about the society and let us answer any questions you might have. This is also the first chance to sign up to our mailing list
        from which you will get a weekly e-mail about all that is going on. It also includes Mark's amazing musical jokes so make sure you don't miss out!
    </p><p>
        Loads of our members get started by just turning up to a rehearsal. If you don't know anyone, or haven't played your instrument in a 
        while this can be a bit daunting but please don't be put off, we're a friendly bunch and will do our best to make sure you have a great 
        time.
    </p><p>
        You can come and try us out for free but if you would like to come regularly, <b>membership is &pound;10 for the year</b> (an absolute bargin). 
        If you're not studying at Edinburgh, you're also very welcome to join and the membership price is the same. Speak to our 
        <a href="~/AboutUs#committee">Treasurer</a> to pay your dues.
    </p>
    <h2>Where do you Rehearse?</h2>
    <p> We meet every Thursday in Alison House, on Nicholson Square. It's just behind Potterow.</p>
        <h4 style="text-align: center">Choir 6pm-7:30pm in lecture room B<br/>
        Orchestra 7:30pm-9pm in lecture room A</h4>
        <p>Both the lecture rooms are on the second floor, go to the top of the stairs, take the door on the left and then turn left for choir, 
            or straight on for orchestra. For the first few weeks we will make sure there are signs up to point you in the right direction. <br/><br/>
            The doors to Alison House have swipe card access after 5pm so you will need your university card to get in. Your card probably
            won't work straight away but if you buy membership we will make sure we get it activated for you, and for the first few weeks we will
            put someome on door duty to make sure you get in! If you are joining us outside this time just drop us an <a href="~/index">e-mail</a> and we'll sort you 
            out.<br/>
