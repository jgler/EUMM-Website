    <p>Take a look through our calendar to see all the exciting events we have coming your way! Click on the individual events for more 
    details. More will be added as and when we finalise the details so make sure you keep an eye on this page and sign up to our mailing 
    list to hear about them. Please note, if an event says TBC it is still in the planning stages and we will try and find a date that 
    suits as many people as possible. </br>
We like to make sure we have something for everyone so if you have any suggestions for future events please get in touch with our 
    <a href="~/AboutUs#committee">social secretary</a>. </p>
