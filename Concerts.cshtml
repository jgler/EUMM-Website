Their long term aim is to build a respite house for young people and their families and excitingly work has recently started on the construction. They were our chosen charity for our 2016 Winter Concert which raised £284 and featured the famous first movement from Beethoven’s 5th symphony, alongside Brahms’ Hungarian Dances and medleys from the Lion King, Aladdin and How To Train Your Dragon.</p>'],

We’ve had our choir and brass band blasting out the tunes over the Edinburgh Christmas Market, and in 2016 we have a lovely captive audience when we sang in the middle of the St Andrew’s Square ice rink. Even better, the crowds seem to have enjoyed it and over the last two years we have raised £240 for Waverley Care who support people living with HIV and Hepatitis C throughout Scotland.</p>'],

        '<p>In January 2017 our third annual tour went north to Aberdeenshire. We had a fantastic time exploring this beautiful part of Scotland and eating enormous ice creams by the beach. We also put on two concerts in Banchory and Stonehaven, which were really well received and raised £470 for our two charities. The International Justice Mission is a global charity working to protect the world’s most vulnerable people from slavery and violence; the Brain Tumour Charity funds scientific research and supports patients and their families. </p>'],

Olivia Giles, founder of the charity, came to speak for us about the fantastic work that this charity does in providing prosthetic limbs to people in Sub-Saharan Africa. The charity has made a huge difference to the lives of many people and the money we raised should be enough to get 4 people up and walking again using sustainable suppliers, and employing local people.</p>']
