    <h2>Georges Bizet - Carmen</h2>
    <p style="margin-top:-3px">1838 – 1875</p>
    <p>Carmen is an opera in four acts by the French composer Georges Bizet. 
        The libretto was written by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy, based on a novella of the same title by Prosper Mérimée. 
        The opera was first performed at the Opéra-Comique in Paris, on 3 March 1875, and at first was not particularly successful. 
        Its initial run extended to 36 performances, before the conclusion of which Bizet died suddenly, and thus knew nothing of the opera's later celebrity.</p>
    <p>
        The opera, written in the genre of opéra comique with musical numbers separated by dialogue, tells the story of the downfall of Don José, 
        a naïve soldier who is seduced by the wiles of the fiery Gypsy, Carmen. José abandons his childhood sweetheart and deserts from his military duties, 
        yet loses Carmen's love to the glamorous toreador Escamillo, after which José kills her in a jealous rage. 
        
    <p>The depictions of proletarian life, immorality and lawlessness, and the tragic death of the main character on stage, broke new ground in French opera 
        and were highly controversial. After the premiere, most reviews were critical, and the French public was generally indifferent.</p>
